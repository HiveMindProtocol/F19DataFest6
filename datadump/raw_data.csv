He doesn't have a fever, but says his stomach hurts & he's very weak. He barely moves off the bed or couch anymore, so not sure if weakness is from lack of moving or from the metastasized bone cancer progressing.

I'm having 7 chemo treatments of weekly Taxol and Carboplatin on Mondays and 35 days of radiation Monday through Friday concurrently. I was shocked when the hair loss occurred on the first chemo. I have NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma stage 3. My goal is to ultimately have an ULL lobectomey. The tumor is 6 cm with suspect lymph node. My radiologist told me it is shrinking and I still have 3 weeks of treatments.

Please share your experience if you dealt with extreme thinning vs complete hair loss.","I am on Carbo/ Alimpta, when I was first dx July 2016!was supposed to have surgery but it never happened since I had Chemo 4 treatments of Altima/ Carbo and daily 36 radiation treatments to the chest. A couple of the main tumors were too close to Aorta so that's why I had the chemo but since I had good response and everything turned to scare tissue no surgery. Since I was EGFR positive at the time I was on Tagrissio for 13 months until I recently had progression which was seen in Dec 6th scans. After blood biopsies we found I am no longer EGFR positive so I stoped the drug ( which killed my appetite the whole time) lost too much weight. Had to start Chemo very 3 weeks first one was Jan 10th, I just had another on Jan 31 and the next one Is Feb. 21 they will will ongoing as I was told. I do have stage 4 since it went in couple of bones as well. I think after the 4 th treatment I will get scared. Reason I was asking about the taxol , last visit my Dr told me my liver enzymes were slightly elevated and Dr said if it continues I would be switched to taxol where you would lose your hair. I also look up all these drugs. What I am in last time my hair thinned but not that bad, a year ago inhadbSBRT radiation to cervical spine and lost 2 rounds patches of hair ( one in left side, one of rift side) it wasn't that noticeable they way I wear my hair. The hair got burnt from the radiation but it did work. Just thinking about the total hair loss just freaked me out. ( yes I know it's hair) but I think I would have a hard time looking at myself, it's just me, I was scared hearing it. They said with taxol it goes by first or sec treatment. They do have really nice wigs out but I think I would be so afraid to look at myself with no hair. When I go to chemo there are some people who go in with bald heads and I get scared seeing that.( I guess it's a fear of mine) I was supposed to be getting a port installed tomm ( tues) but we are having a storm ( good old New York) so procedure is scheduled for Fri now. This is another thing I am petrified off, but I couldn't stall any longer since they said I am getting my veins destroyed. Were you ok when you saw yourself with the no hair? Get a nice wig to go out would probably make you feel better, however it's up to you. It would be great when you are able to have surgery as I was unable to since you can't get cancer there again. I have been treated with gamma knife radiation to the brain already in Aug 2017. It's been a wild ride. BTW I am 10'years younger than you. Do you get steroids as well? I do and the sweats at night for at least a week are no picnic.",2019-02-11 0:00:00,Facebook

Her doc wanted to do iron infusions before we knew she had cancer, which was four weeks ago. Her daughter still wants them done, thinking it will make her stay awake more. Anyone have any thoughts or advise?","Do not give her Iron without talking to the Dr. or hospice nurse. As someone who has been anemic and worked in Pharmacy my whole life Iron supplements are not without side effects and can be extremely constipating and if she is already having stomach or digestion issues it could cause more problems including nausea and pain. If they do feel it would be helpful, they will most likely want it to be intravenous so it bypasses her stomach, since she is already having stomach issues. If the family disagree on medical issues, use the hospice nurse to explain things so there will be less disagreements and or resentment.

38,My dad today went for 6th chemo cycle but his blood report was not good . His haemoglobin was low 11.2 Is it common when you're on chemo ? How to avoid this for the next cycle?,The chemo kills good and bad cells. Our red blood cells are constantly dividing so chemo goes after them and they can’t replicate as fast as we need. This is part of the reason why patients are out of breath (not the only reason but plays a part) red blood cells carry oxygen if we don’t have enough to supply body we get short of breath at times. They usually won’t transfuse unless hemoglobin falls below 7 or if you are symptomatic.,2019-08-13 0:00:00,Facebook

Thankfully, I still have my hair. I do take many supplements, such as Vitamin Bs, and I take 1000 mg of Biotin daily. I sincerely believe that the extra supplements are part of the reason I didn't lose my hair. As with any supplement though, please get your doctor's approval prior to use.

Very best of wishes for your wife & you
I can highly recommend some serious research about nutrition & possibly watch a documentary-series called The Truth About Cancer. It’s a hard watch but it left me feeling very empowered, hopeful, positive & pro-active
All the very best to you both & your family.

It thinned a bit but I changed my care regimen & my hairdresser cut it a little differently to also help. I immediately stopped getting color. I began washing it less often (every 3rd day instead of 2,), lathering once each washing instead of twice. I let it almost air dry b4 using the blow dryer & used Curling iron less often. I have managed to keep most of my hair, thankfully. They stopped the carboplatin first & I remained on Alimta & Keytruda for 35 treatments, 2 yrs. I am in remission & off chemo for 16 months & doing well, although my hair is thinning a bit again. I read somewhere that chemo effects can come back after stopping treatment. Dont know how true that is. I would take a wait & see attitude b4 trying the DigniCap. Good luck.",2018-09-04 0:00:00,Facebook

The last two I was extremely weak. I didn't start to lose my hair until the forth treatment and two months later I'm still losing it. Thick hair and delayed reaction.

Seemed like I was super sick the first week and super achy the second. Used Zofran for nausea and Tramadol for discomfort. THC was helpful and my Dr wrote a script for Meranol. (SP?) Drink tons of water. I weigh 200 and I tried to drink 2 gallons daily. I found soaking in a hot bath helped with the achiness. Bath bombs became an item on our shopping list. Good luck friend.

Take something if you have it. If not, you can drink ginger ale that has gone flat. You need to keep hydrated any way you can. But I imagine the doc has given you something to take. Call the office if you don't have anything; they should call in a prescription. If it's really bad, you may need the ER.

Your job is to flush your system. Drink lots of water or most anything that contains no caffeine (caffeine is a diuretic and can dehydrate you).
Let your oncologist know all your symptoms. He'll guide you as well. (big hugs)",2019-09-16 0:00:00,Facebook
